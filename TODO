* improve API documentation of existing code
* Add some more useful rules
* Make the CLI frontend work with the new code
* Make error/warning know which rule has caused them
* Make token know in which namespace/class/function it is
* Allow adding custom rules (by specifying additional Rule directories)
* Make phpca configurable (see sample phpca.ini for a collection of ideas)
* Add XML output to comply with phpcs
* Port "interesting" rules from phpcs

Rules to add (in no particular order, just a collection of ideas)

* no eval statement
* no deprecated PHPDoc tags (@access, ...)
* one blank after comma in argument lists
* no alternative control structures like if ... endif etc.
