[NoOutputAllowedRule]
list of directories / namespaces / files / classes where no output may be done

WriteToSuperglobalsRule: allow exception list
AccessSuperglobalsRule: only allowed in listed files

EregRule: complain on ereg functions, includes split

skip rules: why a certain rule(s) are skipped for a directory / file / class / namespace

weigh rules + calculate a metric (sum of rule violations in relation to lines of code or "source lines") on how "compliant" the code is.
(exceptions to the rules weigh negatively)

meta rule / rule filter: activate/deactivate and/or configure rules, e.g.
K&R brace style is comprised of several rules.

[DIRECTORY]
skip XyzRule

[CLASS]
skip xyz rule

[FUNCTION]
skip a rulenewfile

[NS]

for skip rules, optional comment why should be required, possibly
phpca should output a skipped message with this string as the reason

namespaces should be treated hiearically, possibly like directories
